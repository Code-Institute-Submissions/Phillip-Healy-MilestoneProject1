# Hammock Software Games - Brand Website

The idea is that this is a brand page for my side project: **Hammock Software Games**.
I will have a landing page discussing who I am and what kind of developer I am, what engine/languages I use etc.
I will implement a page showcasing the game I have released, as well as games in development.
I will create a page for supporters to see how to donate or collaborate.
I will put in a contact form with options for submitting reviews, seeking information, or for submitting collaboration/ideas.
## UX

- As customer I want to see what games you have available.
- As a fan I want to see what you’re working on next, and how far along that game is.
- As a fan I would like to see all your social media in one place, so I don’t miss anything!
- As a customer I would like to have a way to support the development.
- As a customer I would like to be able to leave a review.
- As a fellow developer I would like to discuss ideas for future projects.

## Technologies Used

https://getbootstrap.com/docs/4.4/getting-started/introduction/ Framework for powerful web development.

#### Font Awesome

## Testing

#### Links

All links have been tested on each page to make sure they are live and target correctly.

#### Contact form:

- Go to the "Contact Us" page.
- Try to submit the empty form and verify that an error message about the required fields appears
- Try to submit the form with an invalid email address and verify that a relevant error message appears
- Try to submit the form with all inputs valid and verify that a success message appears.

#### Responsive Design

I made sure that for tablets and mobile the site would collapse and flow for the various screen sizes. 
Icons are dropped to avoid crowding, and columns are made widers and stack on top of each other with new margins to allow for readability. 
Images also move and resize to not block content or overflow off the screen.

## Deployment

#### Github Pages
I deployed this project on Github Pages, the process was to simply follow the settings and it practically launched itself. 

## Credits
### Content
Keeping the footer at the bottom of the page even when content wasn't large enough came from https://dev.to/domysee/keeping-the-footer-at-the-bottom-with-css-flexbox-5h5f
All other code is learned from Code Institute or trial and error.
### Media
The photos used in this site were obtained from myself. 
I created all images and customised them to suit the format.
